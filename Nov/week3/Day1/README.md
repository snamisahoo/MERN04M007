6.Higher order function(HOF):

A function which accepts a function as a parameter is known as HOF It is used to perform multiple operations with different values.

Example:

Function hof (a, b, task){

Let res=task(a,b);

return res;

};

Let add=hof(10,20,function(x , y){

return x + y;

}

Let mul = hof(10,20,function(x , y){

return x*y;

}

Console.log(add());

Console.log(mul());

7.IIF  (Immediately Invoked Function)

The "IIF" in JavaScript, when referred to as a function or expression, stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression.

(function() {

var message = "Hello from an IIFE!";

console.log(message);

*// Logs: "Hello from an IIFE!"*

})();

8.Callback function

This is the function which is used as a argument at the time of calling is known as
callback function.

Mostly we will use arrow function as a callback function because of its less syntax.

**Array special methods**

**forEach Loop in Arrays**

arr.forEach( callBackFunction )

CallbackFunction : Here, it is a function to execute for each element in the array

- A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

**arr. forEach(( val ) => {**

**console.log(val);**

**} )**

**Map**

Creates a new array with the results of some operation. The value its callback returns are used to form new array

arr.map( callbackFnx( value, index, array ) )

**let newArr = arr.map( ( val ) => {**

**return val * 2;**

**} )**

**Filter**

Creates a new array of elements that give true for a condition/filter.

Eg: all even elements

**let newArr = arr.filter( ( val ) => {**

**return val % 2 === 0;**

**} )**

**Reduce**

Performs some operations & reduces the array to a single value. It returns that single value.
